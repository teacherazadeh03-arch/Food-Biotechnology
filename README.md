# Food-Biotechnology
Nonlinear Bioreactor Modelling – Yeast Fermentation. This repository contains a MATLAB model for simulating yeast fermentation dynamics in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) using Monod kinetics. The script is designed to run directly in MATLAB Online, making it easy to use without downloading extra files or setting up local MATLAB environments.
Microorganism
Saccharomyces cerevisiae – common baker’s/brewer’s yeast:
Widely used in industrial fermentation for ethanol production and food biotechnology.
Converts sugars (substrate) into biomass and products.
Growth kinetics modeled using Monod equation (substrate-limited growth).
Model Description

The model simulates the dynamics of biomass (X) and substrate (S) in a CSTR using nonlinear mass balances
